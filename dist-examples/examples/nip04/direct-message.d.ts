/**
 * NIP-04 Direct Message Example
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use the NIP-04 encrypted direct messaging functionality.
 * NIP-04 uses ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) to create a shared secret between
 * the sender and recipient, then encrypts the message with AES-256-CBC.
 *
 * Note: NIP-04 is considered less secure than NIP-44 and has been marked as "unrecommended"
 * in favor of NIP-44. It's provided here for compatibility with older clients.
