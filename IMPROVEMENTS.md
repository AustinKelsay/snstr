# IMPROVEMENT 1: COMPLETED!

There are two independent implementations of the critical getEventHash routine:

export async function getEventHash( … ): Promise<string> {
  const serialized = JSON.stringify([          // no input validation
    0, event.pubkey, event.created_at, …
  ]);
  return await sha256Hash(serialized);
}


export async function getEventHash( … ): Promise<string> {
  // does heavy validation, then…
  const serialized = JSON.stringify(eventData);
  return sha256Hex(serialized);
}

• Which one gets used depends on what file imports it (some code paths use the shallow version, others the validated version).
• Any mismatch will cause signatures to verify in one place and fail in another – a silent consensus failure waiting to happen.
• The "crypto" copy isn't even exported through src/index.ts, so callers that import { getEventHash } from 'snstr'; won't get what the author used in tests. This is an integrity nightmare and a spec violation (NIP-01 §3.1 demands deterministic serialization).


# IMPROVEMENT 2: COMPLETED!

~~NIP-01 validation shortcuts
Relay.validateEvent()
does basic synchronous checks, then deliberately accepts the event before the expensive signature/hash verification is finished:

// ...
this.validateEventAsync(event)
  .then(isValid => {
    if (!isValid) {
      this.triggerEvent(RelayEvent.Error, …)   // only logs
    }
  });
return true;    // event already bubbled to subscribers


A malicious peer can DOS every subscriber with forged events; the relay propagates them, only logging an error much later. Spec wording: "Relays MUST NOT accept an EVENT message that does not validate." (NIP-01 §7). This library violates the MUST.~~

FIXED: The validation flow has been completely rewritten to properly implement NIP-01 §7. Now, the relay:

1. Performs basic synchronous validation first to quickly filter out obviously invalid events
2. Then performs cryptographic validation (hash/signature verification) asynchronously
3. Only processes and propagates events AFTER full validation succeeds
4. Properly rejects and emits errors for invalid events without propagating them

This change ensures that malicious peers cannot flood the network with invalid events, preventing potential DOS attacks on subscribers.
