# NIP-50 Example

This example demonstrates how to use the search filter introduced in [NIPâ€‘50](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/50.md).

The script starts an ephemeral relay, publishes a few notes and then queries them using a search term.

Run with:

```bash
npm run example:nip50
```
