    - `zap.test.ts` - Zap functionality tests

- **Other Directories**:
  - `/types` - Type definitions and helpers for testing
    - `index.ts` - Test utility types and type-safe accessors
  - `/utils` - Tests for utility functions
    - `crypto.test.ts` - Tests for cryptographic utilities
  
- **Root Tests**:
  - `integration.test.ts` - End-to-end integration tests

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests for a specific NIP:

```bash
npm run test:nip01       # Run all NIP-01 core protocol tests
npm run test:nip04       # Run NIP-04 tests
npm run test:nip05       # Run NIP-05 tests
npm run test:nip19       # Run NIP-19 tests
npm run test:nip44       # Run NIP-44 tests
npm run test:nip46       # Run NIP-46 tests
npm run test:nip47       # Run NIP-47 tests
npm run test:nip57       # Run NIP-57 tests
```

For NIP-01 components specifically:

```bash
npm run test:nip01:event    # Run all event-related tests
npm run test:nip01:relay    # Run all relay-related tests
npm run test:nostr          # Run Nostr client tests
npm run test:event          # Run event creation/validation tests
npm run test:relay:connection # Run relay connection tests
```

## Test Categories

Tests are also organized into logical categories:

```bash
npm run test:core        # Core functionality (all NIP-01 tests)
npm run test:crypto      # All crypto (utils/crypto + NIP-04 + NIP-44)
npm run test:identity    # Identity-related (NIP-05, NIP-07, NIP-19)
npm run test:protocols   # Protocol implementations (NIP-46, NIP-47, NIP-57)
npm run test:integration # Run integration tests
```

## Test Coverage

To generate a test coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Writing New Tests

When adding new tests:

1. For a new NIP implementation, create a new directory following the naming convention `nip{XX}`
2. For components of complex NIPs, create subdirectories (e.g., `event/`, `relay/`)
3. Add a README.md to each NIP directory explaining what is being tested
4. Follow the structure outlined in [TEST_STANDARDIZATION.md](./TEST_STANDARDIZATION.md)

## Test Conventions

- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests using Jest's `describe` blocks
- Follow the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate
- Create ephemeral test resources that clean up after tests complete 
- Use the `/types` directory for test-specific type definitions and helpers for type-safety
